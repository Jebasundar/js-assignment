Question 3:
 Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.
  Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program. There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive, composite, and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.
  DATATYPES:
  STRING:
  The string data type is used to represent textual data. Strings are created using single or double quotes.
  NUMBER:
  The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation eg: 19e-4 (equivalent to 19x10-4).
  BOOLEAN:
  The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values.
  OBJECT:
  The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.
  ARRAY:
  An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays.
  FUNCTION:
  The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables.
  UNDEFINED:
  The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
  NULL:
  This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing. A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.
